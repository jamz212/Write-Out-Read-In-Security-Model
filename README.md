A “Write Out, read in” security model is not a new concept; it is existentially the way we communicate; it is how we tell stories (writing out) and how we learn (reading in) applied to information systems. 

There are 2.5 million years of evolutionary history and at least the same amount of empirical evidence of validating this model. Fundamentally, just like in life, we walk a thin line and narrow edge, trying to balance security and business need1. We are lucky when things are not degenerating into chaos or far too much order. 

This position paper attempts to find that balance by modifying how information systems communicate by mimicking the natural way of communicating. The axioms outlined in this paper are the rules that help prevent the corruption of information when “written out or read in.”

While this paper is focused on protecting Industrial Control environments, the principles outlined in this paper are extendable to any environment.
